This is an extremely simple python script that extracts all text from a PDF file. I am well aware that there are several paid features that do this, and others that are free; howver, I always had weird fromatting issues with most of these tools.
Simply provide a file path of a PDF that contains text you with to extract
The program will extract the text and save the output file using the name of the PDF
If a file with this name already exists, a number will be appended to the end automatically to prevent accidental overrighting of another file.
